**Your Task:**
Create a SECURE PATCH that:
1. Completely fixes the vulnerability
2. Preserves all existing functionality
3. Follows the code's existing style and patterns
4. Includes clear comments explaining the fix
5. Adds input validation/sanitisation where needed
6. Uses modern security best practices

Provide BOTH:
1. The complete fixed code (not just the diff)
2. A clear explanation of what changed and why
3. Testing recommendations

Make this production-ready, not just a quick fix."""
